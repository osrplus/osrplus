# Creating a Hero #

Creating a hero is an easy, ten step process. You can make an account on this website and use the wizard to generate your character, or get a pen and paper and create your own sheet by hand.

## 1. Choose a Class & Kit ##
You are cast from an adventuring mold: choose a class that best suits your character concept. Each class comes with a special ability called a technique that’s unique to the class.

A kit describes the sort of life you lead as an adventurer of your class. Each kit provides a special ability that lets you do something special without rolling.

## 2. Choose an Origin ##
If the setting supports it, you may choose an origin. Your origin might be represented as a non-human race, guild, or a nationality. Each origin has a special mechanical advantage and disadvantage. 

## 3. Choose an Ethos ##
Your ethos describes your ethical point of view, how you feel about duty and justice. It guides your moral behavior and outlines what you think is good and evil.

## 4. Create a Conflict & Flaw ##
Your conflict defines you as an adventurer: it is the inciting incident that set you out on your quest. A flaw is a manifestation of that conflict.

## 5. Determine Attributes ##
Divide 10 points between Mighty, Deft, and Smart. These attributes represent a mixture of your natural ability and your adventuring experience. No attribute may start higher than 6. These attributes form the basis for your ability to solve problems in the game.

- Mighty characters are strong, willful, and resilient. 
- Deft characters are agile, charming, and clever.
- Smart characters are bright, calculating, and thoughtful.

Note: If your score is 0 in an attribute, you can’t use skills related to it; if your Smart attribute is 0, you can’t use magic.

## 6. Pick 3 Skills ##
Skills make it easier to solve problems in the game. They add a +2 to your roll if they apply to what you’re doing. Pick skills that you would have learned starting out as an adventurer. 

## 7. Determine Hit Points (HP) ##
You start with 1 HP + your Mighty attribute. If you take damage that would reduce your HP to 0 or less, your HP becomes 0, and you take a wound for each point of damage you take thereafter. When you take a number of wounds equal to or greater than your Might attribute, you're knocked unconscious and left at death's door.

## 8. Determine Fate Points (FP) ##
You start with 3 Fate Points (FP). Spending a point of Fate lets you do one of the following:

- Introduce something minor into the game world that works to your advantage. Oh, so it turns out the shopkeeper is your cousin? Great! Maybe he can cut you a deal on supplies!
- Reroll a die when things go south.
- Defy death when you're at death's door.

Note: Fate Points don’t come back, so use them carefully, but keep in mind that you can only have up to 3 FP at most. The GM may award more to you at the end of a session for good roleplaying.

## 9. Determine Defense ##
Your defense is a d6 + your Deft attribute.

If you have a shield, add the defense bonus it grants to the roll. 
If you have the Reflexes skill, add +2 to the roll. (Note that if you are wielding a shield, you may not add a +2 from your Reflexes.)
10. Grab Your Gear
See Inventory to select your gear.

## 10. For the Magically Inclined ##
Okay, I lied! If you’re playing a class that has access to spells, there are a few more steps you’ll have to take to complete your character. A class that has access to spells is called a spellcaster.

- Determine Magic Points
- Pick spells, if you use them. Take your Smart attribute and divide it half, round down. This is how many spells you know starting out.
- Choose your Maleficence. If you are a spellcaster, you may expend MP to cause harm instead of casting a spell you know. This is called a maleficence. Such physical manifestations of your power take on a shape and form unique to you as a spellcaster.
